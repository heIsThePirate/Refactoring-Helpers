## Folder Structure

```bash
├── waveFuncHelpers/
    ├── data/                  # Original binary (.dat) dataset generated by FORTRAN code
    ├── datasetFiles/          # Formatted wavefunction dataset that can be used in Python for training models
    ├── newData/               # Unformatted text (.txt) dataset generated by FORTRAN code
    ├── niceData/              # Formatted text (.txt) dataset generated by C++ code


├── densityHelpers/
    ├── rho/                   # Unformatted text (.txt) dataset generated by FORTRAN code (can be imported in Python as shown in the corresponding notebook)
```

Directly use the Jupyter Notebook's present in each folder to get the starter code for reading the data (or use numpy/pandas to read the dataset files in a python shell).
